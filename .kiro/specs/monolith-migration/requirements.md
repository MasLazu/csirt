# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the MeUi project from its current complex modular structure to a simplified monolith architecture while transitioning from FastEndpoint CQRS to MediatR CQRS. The migration aims to maintain all existing functionality while simplifying the project structure and improving maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified project structure, so that I can navigate and maintain the codebase more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the project SHALL have a flat, domain-based folder structure instead of the current nested modular structure
2. WHEN organizing the code THEN the system SHALL group related functionality by domain (Authentication, Authorization, User Management) rather than by technical layers
3. WHEN structuring projects THEN the system SHALL have a maximum of 6-8 projects instead of the current 20+ projects
4. IF a developer needs to find authentication logic THEN the system SHALL have all authentication-related code in a single domain folder
5. WHEN building the solution THEN the system SHALL maintain the same build performance or better

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use MediatR for CQRS implementation, so that I can leverage industry-standard patterns and better testability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing command handling THEN the system SHALL use MediatR IRequest and IRequestHandler interfaces instead of FastEndpoint's command execution
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL use MediatR query handlers instead of current query implementations
3. WHEN handling cross-cutting concerns THEN the system SHALL use MediatR pipeline behaviors for validation, logging, and transaction management
4. IF a command or query is executed THEN the system SHALL route it through MediatR's mediator pattern
5. WHEN testing handlers THEN the system SHALL allow easy unit testing of individual handlers without FastEndpoint dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to keep FastEndpoints for HTTP handling, so that I can maintain the current API performance and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL continue to use FastEndpoints for request/response handling
2. WHEN an endpoint receives a request THEN the system SHALL delegate business logic to MediatR handlers instead of executing commands directly
3. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL maintain the current response format and status codes
4. IF an endpoint needs validation THEN the system SHALL use FastEndpoint's built-in validation while delegating business logic to MediatR
5. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain Swagger documentation generation through FastEndpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean layered architecture, so that I can maintain separation of concerns and testability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow a clear Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layer structure
2. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL place domain entities and business rules in the Domain layer
3. WHEN handling application logic THEN the system SHALL place MediatR handlers, DTOs, and application services in the Application layer
4. IF data access is needed THEN the system SHALL implement repositories and database contexts in the Infrastructure layer
5. WHEN exposing APIs THEN the system SHALL place FastEndpoint controllers in the Presentation layer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing functionality, so that the migration doesn't break any current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL support all current authentication methods (JWT, Password)
2. WHEN accessing authorization features THEN the system SHALL maintain all RBAC functionality
3. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing endpoints and their behavior
4. IF database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain all current Entity Framework functionality and migrations
5. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all current Serilog configuration and behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified dependency injection, so that service registration is more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering services THEN the system SHALL have a single, clear service registration approach instead of multiple extension methods
2. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL use a simplified Program.cs with clear service registration
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent pattern for service registration
4. IF MediatR is configured THEN the system SHALL auto-register all handlers from the application assemblies
5. WHEN managing database contexts THEN the system SHALL have a single, unified database context registration approach

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved testing capabilities, so that I can write better unit and integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL allow testing of MediatR handlers in isolation
2. WHEN testing business logic THEN the system SHALL not require FastEndpoint infrastructure for handler testing
3. WHEN creating integration tests THEN the system SHALL support testing complete request flows through MediatR
4. IF mocking is needed THEN the system SHALL allow easy mocking of dependencies through standard interfaces
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve current test execution performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling, so that all errors are handled uniformly across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions occur in handlers THEN the system SHALL use MediatR pipeline behaviors for consistent error handling
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses across all endpoints
3. WHEN business rule violations occur THEN the system SHALL handle them through a unified exception handling mechanism
4. IF logging is needed for errors THEN the system SHALL maintain current Serilog integration
5. WHEN returning error responses THEN the system SHALL preserve current error response formats for API compatibility
