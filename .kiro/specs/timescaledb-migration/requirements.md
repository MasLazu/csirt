# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature migrates threat intelligence data from MongoDB to TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension) to improve query performance for time-series data. The system will redesign the data storage using TimescaleDB's hypertables optimized for time-series queries, implement EF Core for data access, and create a Go application for data migration. This migration addresses performance bottlenecks in the current MongoDB implementation while maintaining API compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to design TimescaleDB tables optimized for threat intelligence time-series data, so that query performance is significantly improved over MongoDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the main threat table THEN the system SHALL use TimescaleDB hypertables partitioned by timestamp
2. WHEN storing threat data THEN the system SHALL normalize related data into separate tables (ASN info, countries, protocols)
3. WHEN creating indexes THEN the system SHALL optimize for common query patterns (time ranges, IP addresses, ASN)
4. WHEN designing the schema THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity with proper foreign key relationships
5. WHEN partitioning data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate time intervals for optimal performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement EF Core entities and configurations for TimescaleDB, so that the application can query threat data using strongly-typed LINQ queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating EF Core entities THEN the system SHALL map to TimescaleDB tables with proper relationships
2. WHEN configuring entities THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-specific data types and features
3. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL leverage EF Core's query optimization for PostgreSQL
4. WHEN handling time-series queries THEN the system SHALL use TimescaleDB-specific functions and aggregations
5. WHEN creating migrations THEN the system SHALL include TimescaleDB hypertable creation commands

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want a Go application to migrate existing MongoDB data to TimescaleDB, so that historical threat intelligence data is preserved during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading from MongoDB THEN the migration tool SHALL handle all existing document structures
2. WHEN transforming data THEN the migration tool SHALL normalize data according to the new schema design
3. WHEN writing to TimescaleDB THEN the migration tool SHALL batch insert data for optimal performance
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the migration tool SHALL log failures and continue processing
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the migration tool SHALL provide status updates and completion metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the existing threat intelligence queries to use EF Core with TimescaleDB, so that the API maintains compatibility while benefiting from improved performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating query handlers THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API contracts and response formats
2. WHEN implementing filters THEN the system SHALL support all current filtering capabilities
3. WHEN executing time-range queries THEN the system SHALL leverage TimescaleDB's time-series optimizations
4. WHEN performing aggregations THEN the system SHALL use TimescaleDB's continuous aggregates where appropriate
5. WHEN handling pagination THEN the system SHALL optimize for large result sets using TimescaleDB features

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migration to be reversible and testable, so that we can safely transition from MongoDB to TimescaleDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing migration THEN the system SHALL maintain MongoDB data as backup during transition
2. WHEN testing the migration THEN the system SHALL provide data validation tools to compare results
3. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL support switching back to MongoDB if issues arise
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics comparing MongoDB vs TimescaleDB query times
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support gradual rollout with feature flags

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for the new TimescaleDB implementation, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry logic
2. WHEN queries timeout THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate error responses
3. WHEN data inconsistencies occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting capabilities
5. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms and error recovery
