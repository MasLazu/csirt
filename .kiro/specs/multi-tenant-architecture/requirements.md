# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive multi-tenant architecture for the threat intelligence application. The system will support tenant-based data isolation, where super administrators can create tenants and assign ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) to specific tenants. This enables organizations to have dedicated access to their relevant threat intelligence data while maintaining proper security boundaries and administrative control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to create and manage tenants, so that I can organize different organizations or departments with their own isolated data access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super administrator accesses the tenant management interface THEN the system SHALL display options to create, edit, and delete tenants
2. WHEN creating a new tenant THEN the system SHALL require a unique tenant name, description, and contact information
3. WHEN a tenant is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique tenant identifier and store tenant metadata
4. WHEN editing a tenant THEN the system SHALL allow modification of tenant name, description, and contact information
5. WHEN deleting a tenant THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if ASNs are still assigned to the tenant
6. WHEN viewing tenants THEN the system SHALL display a paginated list with tenant details and assigned ASN counts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to assign ASNs to tenants, so that tenants can access threat intelligence data relevant to their assigned autonomous systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super administrator accesses ASN assignment interface THEN the system SHALL display available ASNs and current tenant assignments
2. WHEN assigning an ASN to a tenant THEN the system SHALL ensure the ASN is not already assigned to another tenant
3. WHEN assigning multiple ASNs THEN the system SHALL support bulk assignment operations
4. WHEN removing ASN assignments THEN the system SHALL update tenant access permissions immediately
5. WHEN viewing ASN assignments THEN the system SHALL show which tenant each ASN belongs to
6. WHEN an ASN is unassigned THEN the system SHALL make associated threat data inaccessible to the previous tenant

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to manage users within my tenant, so that I can control who has access to our organization's threat intelligence data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator logs in THEN the system SHALL restrict access to only their tenant's data and users
2. WHEN creating users within a tenant THEN the system SHALL automatically associate them with the current tenant
3. WHEN viewing users THEN the system SHALL only display users belonging to the same tenant
4. WHEN assigning roles to users THEN the system SHALL only allow roles that are valid within the tenant context
5. WHEN a user is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all tenant-specific permissions and access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want to access threat intelligence data for my organization's ASNs, so that I can monitor and analyze security threats relevant to our network infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant user queries threat intelligence data THEN the system SHALL only return data associated with their tenant's assigned ASNs
2. WHEN accessing threat analytics dashboards THEN the system SHALL filter all visualizations to show only tenant-relevant data
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include only threat data from the tenant's ASN scope
4. WHEN using search functionality THEN the system SHALL apply tenant-based filtering automatically
5. WHEN accessing real-time threat feeds THEN the system SHALL stream only threats related to tenant ASNs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want tenant data to be completely isolated, so that no tenant can access another tenant's sensitive threat intelligence information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database query is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically apply tenant filtering at the data access layer
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate tenant context before processing requests
3. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL include tenant identifiers to prevent cross-tenant data leakage
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL include tenant context for audit and debugging purposes
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL maintain tenant boundaries in backup and restore operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a super administrator, I want to monitor tenant usage and system health, so that I can ensure optimal performance and resource allocation across all tenants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing system monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display per-tenant usage statistics and metrics
2. WHEN viewing tenant activity THEN the system SHALL show login patterns, data access frequency, and resource consumption
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify which tenant operations are impacting performance
4. WHEN generating usage reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics for billing and capacity planning
5. WHEN setting resource limits THEN the system SHALL enforce per-tenant quotas for API calls and data access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the multi-tenant architecture to be transparent to existing application logic, so that current features continue to work without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing queries are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically inject tenant filtering without code changes
2. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL provide clear patterns for tenant-aware implementation
3. WHEN database migrations are run THEN the system SHALL handle tenant-specific schema changes appropriately
4. WHEN testing applications THEN the system SHALL support tenant context switching for comprehensive testing
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL maintain tenant isolation during deployment processes
