# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing tenant-aware permission endpoints that allow tenants to manage their own permissions, actions, resources, pages, and page groups within their isolated tenant context. Currently, the system only has global authorization endpoints that are not tenant-aware, and tenant user management endpoints. This feature will complete the tenant permission system by providing full CRUD operations for authorization entities within the tenant scope.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to view all permissions available within my tenant context, so that I can understand what permissions can be assigned to tenant users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests tenant permissions THEN the system SHALL return only permissions relevant to the tenant context
2. WHEN a tenant administrator accesses the tenant permissions endpoint THEN the system SHALL filter permissions based on the current tenant context
3. WHEN the tenant permissions are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include permission details such as name, description, and associated actions/resources
4. IF the user is not authenticated as a tenant user THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
5. IF the tenant context is not available THEN the system SHALL return a tenant context required error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to view all actions available within my tenant context, so that I can understand what actions are available for permission assignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests tenant actions THEN the system SHALL return only actions relevant to the tenant context
2. WHEN tenant actions are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include action details such as name and description
3. WHEN the request is made without proper tenant authentication THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. IF the tenant context is missing THEN the system SHALL return a tenant context required error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to view all resources available within my tenant context, so that I can understand what resources can be protected by permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests tenant resources THEN the system SHALL return only resources relevant to the tenant context
2. WHEN tenant resources are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include resource details such as name and description
3. WHEN the request lacks proper tenant authentication THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. IF the tenant context is not provided THEN the system SHALL return a tenant context required error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to view all pages available within my tenant context, so that I can manage page access for tenant users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests tenant pages THEN the system SHALL return only pages accessible within the tenant context
2. WHEN tenant pages are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include page details such as name, path, description, and associated page group
3. WHEN the request is made without tenant authentication THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. IF the tenant context is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a tenant context required error
5. WHEN pages are returned THEN the system SHALL include information about which pages are currently accessible to the requesting tenant user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to view all page groups available within my tenant context, so that I can understand the page organization structure for my tenant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests tenant page groups THEN the system SHALL return only page groups relevant to the tenant context
2. WHEN tenant page groups are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include page group details such as name, description, and associated pages
3. WHEN the request lacks tenant authentication THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. IF the tenant context is missing THEN the system SHALL return a tenant context required error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to get accessible pages for a specific tenant user, so that I can verify what pages a tenant user can access within our tenant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests accessible pages for a tenant user THEN the system SHALL return only pages accessible to that user within the tenant context
2. WHEN accessible pages are retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate that the target user belongs to the same tenant as the requesting administrator
3. WHEN the target tenant user does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
4. WHEN the target tenant user belongs to a different tenant THEN the system SHALL return a forbidden error
5. IF the requesting user lacks proper permissions THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want to get permissions for a specific tenant user, so that I can review and audit what permissions are assigned to users in my tenant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant administrator requests permissions for a tenant user THEN the system SHALL return all permissions assigned to that user within the tenant context
2. WHEN tenant user permissions are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include both direct permissions and permissions inherited through roles
3. WHEN the target tenant user does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
4. WHEN the target tenant user belongs to a different tenant THEN the system SHALL return a forbidden error
5. IF the requesting user lacks proper permissions THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all tenant permission endpoints to follow consistent patterns, so that the API is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tenant permission endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the same URL pattern as existing tenant endpoints (/api/v1/tenant/...)
2. WHEN tenant permission endpoints are created THEN they SHALL implement ITenantPermissionProvider interface
3. WHEN tenant permission endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL require proper tenant context validation
4. WHEN tenant permission endpoints return data THEN they SHALL use consistent response formats with other tenant endpoints
5. WHEN tenant permission endpoints encounter errors THEN they SHALL return standardized error responses

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tenant permission endpoints to have proper authorization, so that only authorized tenant users can access tenant-specific permission data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tenant permission endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL define appropriate permission strings following the pattern "ACTION:RESOURCE"
2. WHEN permission validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check both the permission and tenant context
3. WHEN a user lacks the required permission THEN the system SHALL return a forbidden error
4. WHEN the tenant context validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate tenant-related errors
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want tenant permission endpoints to be performant, so that permission-related operations don't impact the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tenant permission data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL use efficient database queries with proper indexing
2. WHEN large datasets are returned THEN the system SHALL implement pagination where appropriate
3. WHEN permission data is accessed frequently THEN the system SHALL consider caching strategies
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL include proper tenant filtering to avoid cross-tenant data leakage
5. WHEN multiple permission-related queries are needed THEN the system SHALL optimize to minimize database round trips
