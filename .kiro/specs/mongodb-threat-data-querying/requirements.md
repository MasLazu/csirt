# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables querying and managing threat intelligence data stored in MongoDB using the existing repository pattern. The system needs to handle security event records that contain network traffic information, ASN details, and threat categorization data. The implementation will extend the current MongoDB repository to work with threat intelligence entities while maintaining the existing BaseEntity structure and soft delete functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to query threat intelligence data by various criteria, so that I can analyze security events and identify patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying by ASN THEN the system SHALL return all threat records matching the specified ASN
2. WHEN querying by source IP address THEN the system SHALL return all threat records from that IP
3. WHEN querying by destination IP address THEN the system SHALL return all threat records targeting that IP
4. WHEN querying by country (source or destination) THEN the system SHALL return all threat records from/to that country
5. WHEN querying by threat category THEN the system SHALL return all threat records of that category
6. WHEN querying by protocol THEN the system SHALL return all threat records using that protocol
7. WHEN querying by port (source or destination) THEN the system SHALL return all threat records using that port
8. WHEN querying by malware family THEN the system SHALL return all threat records associated with that family

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to filter threat data by time ranges, so that I can analyze threats within specific periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying with a start date THEN the system SHALL return only records with timestamps after that date
2. WHEN querying with an end date THEN the system SHALL return only records with timestamps before that date
3. WHEN querying with both start and end dates THEN the system SHALL return records within that time range
4. WHEN no date filter is provided THEN the system SHALL return all available records

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to retrieve paginated threat data results, so that I can efficiently browse large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting paginated results THEN the system SHALL return the specified number of records per page
2. WHEN requesting a specific page THEN the system SHALL return records for that page number
3. WHEN requesting sorted results THEN the system SHALL return records ordered by the specified field
4. WHEN requesting the total count THEN the system SHALL return the total number of matching records

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to perform complex queries combining multiple criteria, so that I can conduct detailed threat analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN combining multiple filter criteria THEN the system SHALL return records matching ALL specified conditions
2. WHEN using OR conditions THEN the system SHALL return records matching ANY of the specified conditions
3. WHEN using negation filters THEN the system SHALL exclude records matching the specified criteria
4. WHEN using wildcard searches THEN the system SHALL return records with partial matches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the threat data to integrate with the existing repository pattern, so that it maintains consistency with the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating threat entities THEN the system SHALL inherit from BaseEntity
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL use the existing IRepository interface
3. WHEN soft deleting records THEN the system SHALL set DeletedAt timestamp
4. WHEN querying records THEN the system SHALL exclude soft-deleted records by default
5. WHEN tracking changes THEN the system SHALL update CreatedAt and UpdatedAt timestamps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data mapping between MongoDB documents and C# entities, so that the application can work with strongly-typed objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping MongoDB ObjectId THEN the system SHALL convert to/from Guid for the Id property
2. WHEN mapping nested objects THEN the system SHALL properly serialize/deserialize complex properties
3. WHEN mapping dates THEN the system SHALL handle MongoDB date format conversion
4. WHEN mapping optional fields THEN the system SHALL handle null values appropriately
5. WHEN mapping arrays THEN the system SHALL properly handle collection properties
